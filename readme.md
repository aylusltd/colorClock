Wanted to see how it worked, realized it was in flash, so rewrote it in Javascript.

Thinking about turning it into a jQuery plugin.

Interestingly, trying to write it independent of any libraries or external dependencies this trivial little problem helped me understand the structure of jQuery much better.

Hope somebody finds it useful. Thinking about using it in a class I'm teaching.
